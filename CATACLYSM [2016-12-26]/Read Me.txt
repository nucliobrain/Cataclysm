Thank you for downloading Cataclysm!  Your feedback is essential for me to complete the game, so please
hop onto my WIP thread to tell me what you think: https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/cataclysm-wip.447660/

This game is exclusively for two-player local matches.  It would be cool to expand on that (online,
four-players, etc.) in the future, but for now you'll only need one friend and two game controllers to play.

As the icons in the game suggest, I designed the game with Playstation in mind.  This was for no reason other
than that the only controllers I could get to work on my PC were my Dualshock3s.  I use MotioninJoy with the
Xinput-Default mode, so doing this should give you the proper button layout (though I have not been able to
test other types of controllers yet).  Just in case you get a weird button-map, here's a quick reference for
how it *should* be set up:

Action					PS/Xbox

move player				Left Stick or D-pad
aim cursor without moving		Right Stick
run/stick to walls			hold L1/LB
cook/throw bombs			R1/RB
melee attack				square/X (can be used with LS-up and LS-down (in air)
jump					X/A
active remote/force bombs		O/B
mute music				select/back
pause game				start

If you have any questions/comments, again, please use my WIP thread on the Unity forum:
