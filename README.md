Cataclysm game WIP build
Thank you for downloading Cataclysm!  Your feedback is essential for me to complete the game, so please
hop onto my WIP thread to tell me what you think: https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/cataclysm-wip.447660/

This game is exclusively for two-player local matches.  It would be cool to expand on that (online,
four-players, etc.) in the future, but for now you'll only need one friend and two game controllers to play.

As the icons in the game suggest, I designed the game with Playstation in mind.  This was for no reason other
than that the only controllers I could get to work on my PC were my Dualshock3s.  I use MotioninJoy with the
Xinput-Default mode, so doing this should give you the proper button layout (though I have not been able to
test other types of controllers yet).  Just in case you get a weird button-map, here's a quick reference for
how it *should* be set up:

Action					PS/Xbox

move player				Left Stick or D-pad
aim cursor without moving		Right Stick
run/stick to walls			hold L1/LB
cook/throw bombs			R1/RB
melee attack				square/X (can be used with LS-up and LS-down (in air)
jump					X/A
active remote/force bombs		O/B
mute music				select/back
pause game				start

If you have any questions/comments, again, please use my WIP thread on the Unity forum:
